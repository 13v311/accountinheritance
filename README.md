Basically an ATM simulation that I made senior year of HS
Lets you see your Savings and Checking accounts, as well as check your credit.
Lets you see your monthly statements and your balances, included with apr, overdraft fees, and interest rates.
Also lets you make purchases with a credit card, and review the effects of said purchases (being added to your credit balance).
Lets you withdraw from and deposit money into your checking account, and check its balance.
Lets you withdraw from and deposit money into your savings account, check the balance, as well as set a goal for how much you would like to save up to, and see the progress that you would need to make to do so.
Accounts for edge cases such as if the user enters a choice that is not availble.
